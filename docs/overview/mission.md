**Systemfehler** is a public-interest open platform designed to make information about social benefits, rights, and support programs in Germany accessible to everyone â€” especially to people facing bureaucratic, linguistic, or informational barriers.

### Goals
- Provide **transparent**, **searchable**, and **archived** access to official benefit information.
- Translate and simplify complex administrative language (Amtsdeutsch) into **understandable German and English**.
- Preserve public data even if official sources remove or change it.
- Enable collaboration between users, NGOs, and legal advisors.

### Core Principles
1. Open Data by default (CC BY 4.0)
2. Multilingual and inclusive design
3. Traceable data provenance
4. Collaboration through open-source governance
